# MacePU

Project: Macpu & Massembly Assembler 


Lead: Alan M. Walker


Language: C 


IDE: Visual Studio 2015


OS tested on: Windows 10 


Disclaimer: 


I am no expert in CPU architecture nor in the standard practices and coding standards of the C programming language. I am, however, a C++ programmer who specialises in creating games.
This project is to assist me in understanding more of the low level operations that occur in a CPU and to better understand how to create efficient code using low level understandings. 
I am perfectly happy for anyone, who so wishes, to take the project further. If this project assists you as a learning aide then it did for you what I'm hoping it does for me. 


Thanks
